🛠️ Telemetry Data Analysis Report – Daikibo Machine Breakdown Study

📊 Project Overview

This project involved analyzing telemetry data collected by Daikibo, a company that manages various types of factory machines. The analysis was conducted using Tableau, with the goal of identifying breakdown patterns and critical problem points across different factory locations and machine types.

🎯 Objectives

1. Determine which location experienced the highest number of machine breakdowns.


2. Identify the machine types that were most frequently unhealthy in the most affected location.



🔍 Methodology

Tool Used: Tableau

Data Source: JSON file containing telemetry logs for machines across multiple factory locations.

Approach:

Imported and cleaned the dataset.

Created calculated fields to classify machine health.

Built visual dashboards to compare unhealthy machine counts by location and machine type.

Filtered the analysis to focus on high-risk areas.


📈 Key Insights

✅ 1. Factory Breakdown Analysis

Seiko Factory reported the highest number of unhealthy machines — 480 in total.

Berlin Factory had the least breakdowns, with just 20 unhealthy machines recorded.


✅ 2. Machine Type Breakdown in Seiko Factory

The Laser Welder machine was the most problematic, with 480 units marked as unhealthy.

In contrast, CNC Machines, Spot Welders, and Conveyor Belts had the fewest breakdowns — only 10 unhealthy machines each.

📌 Implications

The Seiko Factory requires urgent maintenance optimization and possibly a review of its operational procedures.

Laser Welders should be prioritized for preventive maintenance schedules and condition monitoring across all factories, especially in Seiko.

The Berlin Factory could be studied further to uncover best practices that can be replicated in Seiko and other underperforming locations.
