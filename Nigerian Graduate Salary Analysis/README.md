💼 Nigerian Graduate Salary Analysis Report

By Fidelis Okpiliya | Data Analyst
📊 A Deep Dive into Post-Graduation Earnings in Nigeria

🗂️ Project Summary

I recently explored a dataset sourced from Kaggle that surveyed Nigerian graduates' post-graduation outcomes, including their earnings, degree class, gender, and more. The purpose of this project was to uncover hidden patterns behind graduate salary trends in Nigeria.

💻 Tools & Technologies Used:

SQL: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib): Data Analysis

Power BI: Visualizations & Dashboard Design

🔍 Key Findings

📌 1. Average Net Salary by State

Rivers State recorded the highest average net salary among graduates.

Plateau State had the lowest.

This suggests geographical influence plays a significant role in salary distribution, possibly due to economic activity levels, industries, and infrastructure.

📌 2. Average Net Salary by Gender

Male graduates earn more on average compared to female graduates.

This aligns with broader gender pay gap concerns in many job markets and industries.

📌 3. Average Net Salary by Class of Degree

🎯 Surprising Insight!

Third Class graduates had the highest average net salary!

Second Class Lower degree holders earned the least.

This challenges the traditional narrative that "First Class = Higher Pay," suggesting that other factors like skill, experience, networking, or location may have stronger influence.

📌 4. Impact of Age on Net Salary

A strong negative correlation was found between age and salary.

📉 Regression analysis shows that for every 1-year increase in age, there's a 0.04% decrease in salary.

This might reflect industry bias toward younger employees, or older graduates entering the workforce later with limited negotiation power.

🧠 Takeaways

Your degree class does not guarantee high income.
Where you live and work (state-wise) has a huge impact on your earnings.
Gender and age continue to play silent but measurable roles in economic outcomes.
Skills, adaptability, and industry matter more than academic achievements alone

✅ Recommendations
Based on the analysis of the Nigerian Graduate Salary Dataset, here are key recommendations for:

🎓 Graduates & Job Seekers

1. Prioritize Skill Over Grade
While good academic performance is valuable, real-world skills, certifications, and hands-on experience play a bigger role in earnings. Third-class graduates earning the highest average salary in this dataset proves that grades alone don't determine success.
2. Leverage High-Income States
Consider relocating or remote job hunting in higher-paying states like Rivers, Lagos, and Abuja. These locations offer better pay due to concentrated economic activity and access to corporate headquarters.
3. Bridge the Gender Gap
Female graduates should be empowered with negotiation skills, mentorship, and leadership training to compete equally. Employers and institutions must create safe spaces for women to grow and lead.
4. Age is Not a Limiting Factor — Re-skill and Re-strategize
Since older graduates tend to earn less, focus on continuous learning, digital skills, and entrepreneurship to remain competitive and adaptable in evolving industries

🏢 Employers & Policymakers

1. Rethink Hiring Bias Based on Degree Class
Companies should hire based on competence, not just CGPA. Many lower-class graduates are excelling in the workforce, especially in tech and business sectors.
2. Address Regional Pay Disparity
Governments and companies should invest in economic decentralization — providing more opportunities in underpaid states like Plateau, Zamfara, and Kebbi. This reduces urban migration and improves national income balance.
3. Encourage Postgraduate & Vocational Education
Though not the strongest salary driver in this dataset, postgraduate studies can still improve opportunities if tied to industry relevance. Focused programs like data science, digital marketing, or project management may yield better returns than traditional postgraduate degrees.
